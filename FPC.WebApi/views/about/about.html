					<p>Thank you for your interest in our church! We are truly excited that you want to know more about us. We would love for you to come visit with us and we hope that your experience leads you to a greater relationship with God.</p>
					<p>Come as you are and worship with us in a contemporary style worship where you will be at liberty to express yourself in the spirit of worship as you encounter the Almighty God. His word tells us that "where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty" (II Corinthians 3:17). You will enjoy positive, uplifting music during our worship service, and that will be accompanied by Bible-based teaching and preaching, delivered with love and compassion.</p>
					<p>First Pentecostal Church is a family of believers from various backgrounds who have come together to be bound by many common threads. When listening to the testimonies of many of the people here, a common theme emerges…we were all ordinary people who were in search of something more and were looking for a place to be genuinely loved.  In our search for the truth, a moment of clarity had finally arrived and the search was over.  From the first visit until the current, we experienced what we are confident you will experience here at New Life.  The natural gave way to the supernatural.  The mundane became the miraculous.  The ordinary had been transformed into the extraordinary.</p>
					<p>If you want a fresh and bold look at Jesus, we would love for you to come and see what He is all about. We hope that you find yourself feeling closer to God.</p>

					<p>First Pentecostal Church of Oakwood is a part of  a much larger organization called the United Pentecostal Church International.  The United Pentecostal Church International (UPCI) has been among the fastest growing church organizations since it was formed in 1945 by the merger of the Pentecostal Church Incorporated and the Pentecostal Assemblies of Jesus Christ. From 521 churches in 1945, the UPCI in the United States and Canada grew to 4,400 churches (including daughter works and preaching points) and 9,234 ministers in 2012. In the same year it reported works in 203 nations outside the U.S. and Canada with 36,804 churches and preaching points, 22,129 licensed ministers, 853 missionaries, and a constituency of 2.4 million. The international fellowship consists of national organizations that are united as the Global Council of the UPCI, which is chaired by the general superintendent of the UPCI. Total constituency is estimated at 3 million.</p>
					<p>The UPCI emerged out of the Pentecostal movement that began with a Bible school in Topeka, Kansas, in 1901 and with the Azusa Street Revival in Los Angeles, California, in 1906. It traces its organizational roots to 1916, when a large group of Pentecostal ministers began to unite around the teaching of the oneness of God and water baptism in the name of Jesus Christ. The governmental structure of the UPCI is basically congregational in that local churches are self-governing: the congregation elects its pastor and other leaders, owns its property, decides its budget, establishes its membership, and conducts all necessary business.</p>
					<p>The general organization embraces a modified presbyterian system in that ministers meet in sectional, district, and general conferences to elect officials and to conduct business of the organization. The highest governing body of the UPCI is the General Conference, and between conferences it is governed by the Board of General Presbyters (General Board). Its chief officers are a general superintendent, a general secretary-treasurer, and two assistant general superintendents. World Evangelism Center is the UPCI headquarters building located in Hazelwood, Missouri, a suburb of St. Louis. It houses offices for its general officials, eight divisions, the Pentecostal Publishing House, and the Center for the Study of Oneness Pentecostalism with an attached gift shop. Among the endorsed institutions of the UPCI are six Bible colleges, a Christian college, a graduate school, an three ministry training institutes, a children's home, a residency for troubled young men, a ministry to those addicted to alcohol and other drugs, an adoption agency with a home for unwed mothers, a chaplaincy for prisoners, a radio ministry, a church-based ministry training institute, an agency for community educational services, and an international relief agency. It also endorses chaplains to the military.</p>

				<h2>What do we believe?</h2>
				<p>First Pentecostal Church of Oakwood is a Bible-based church. We're Bible-based in that we seek to base all of our beliefs and our lifestyle on explicit passages of the Bible or on biblical principles. Based on Scripture, we believe the following:</p>

				<div uib-accordion-group class="panel-default" heading="Fundamental Doctrine">
					<p>The basic and fundamental doctrine of this organization shall be the Bible standard of full salvation, which is repentance, baptism in water by immersion in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and the baptism of the Holy Ghost with the initial sign of speaking with other tongues as the Spirit gives the utterance.</p>
					<p>We shall endeavor to keep the unity of the Spirit until we all come into the unity of the faith, at the same time admonishing all brethren that they shall not contend for their different views to the disunity of the body.</p>
				</div>

				<div uib-accordion-group class="panel-default" heading="The Bible">
					<p>We believe that the bible is the infallible word of God penned by men as they were moved on by the Holy Spirit.  We must accept it in its entirety.  Although it was written many years ago, its truths still remain relevant in this day and age.</p>
				</div>

				<div uib-accordion-group class="panel-default" heading="Jesus Christ">
					<p>We believe that Jesus Christ is the living God made flesh (John 1:1-14) who came to earth to save us from our sins.</p>
				</div>

				<div uib-accordion-group class="panel-default" heading="Repentance">
					<p>We are born into sin (Romans 3:23) and if we continue in our sin (Romans 6:23) we are bound to suffer for eternity in hell, a place intended for satan.  Just as Jesus died, we must die to our sins in repentance.  Repentance is more than merely feeling sorry that we’ve done wrong but it is a willingness to turn away from those sins.</p>
				</div>

				<div uib-accordion-group class="panel-default" heading="Baptism">
					<p>Just as Jesus was buried, we must also be buried (baptized).  We must be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ as it was performed in the bible (Acts 19:4-5; 2:38; 4:12).  We are baptized for the remission of our sins.</p>
				</div>

				<div uib-accordion-group class="panel-default" heading="The Holy Spirit">
					<p>Once we are figuratively dead and buried, we must be resurrected as Jesus rose from the dead.  We are resurrected into new life with Him by being filled with the Holy Ghost (Acts 19:2) evidenced by speaking in other tongues (Acts 19:6; 2:1-4, 37-39).</p>
				</div>

				<div uib-accordion-group class="panel-default" heading="Worship">
					<p>We believe worship should be a time of refreshing and rejuvenation.  Throughout the word of God his people praised Him with exuberance out of the abundance of their heart.  Psalm 134:2 tells us to lift up our hands in the sanctuary.  We play instruments and clap our hands because Psalm 150 instructs us to “Praise him with the timbrel and dance: praise Him with stringed instruments and organs”.  Our worship should be an outward expression of what we feel in our hearts.  When you visit First Pentecostal Church you will see, feel and hear worship because it is in our hearts.  Come experience God like you’ve never felt Him before.</p>
					<p>If you have any questions regarding our beliefs we would be glad to set up a home bible study with you.  Feel free to contact us and request a bible study and we will come to your home or wherever you wish and open up God’s word and examine it together.  We have a variety of bible studies ranging from 1 hour to 12 weeks in length. Let us know in person, or by filling out the contact form below.</p>
